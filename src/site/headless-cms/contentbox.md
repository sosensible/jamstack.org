## What Is ContentBox?

ContentBox is a professional open-source hybrid modular CMS (Content Management System) that allows you to easily build websites, blogs, wikis, complex web applications, and even power mobile or cloud applications. Built with a secure and flexible modular core, designed to scale, and combined with world-class support, ContentBox will quickly get your projects out the door.

## Using ContentBox as a Headless CMS

The WordPress CMS already gives site developers a method for server-side rendering (SSR) using themes based on PHP templates, but the platform also offers a robust and extensible REST API that allows developers to create headless sites and apps using any manner of frontend technologies. 

### REST API

The [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) has been a stable feature of the platform for a number of years, and offers structured access to site content and settings over HTTP. Using existing patterns, developers can extend the API to support custom content types or create unique routes that support any use case that can be created with PHP and its associated libraries and tools.
